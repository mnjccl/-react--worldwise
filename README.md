In the build process, I used the Vite tool. The application consists of over 25 components and is styled using CSS modules. It is run with the command "npm run dev". The task in this application involves manipulating components, including utilizing React Router for navigation. App is not hosted so itâ€™s run locally, requiring both `npm run dev` for the client and `npm run server` for the server to function.
